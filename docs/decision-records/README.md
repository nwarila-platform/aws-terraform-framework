# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) governing this
repository, split into three scopes per [ADR-0001](org/0001-use-architecture-decision-records.md):

- [`org/`](org/) - byte-identical mirrors of the org-baseline ADRs whose
  master copies live in [`nwarila-platform/.github`](https://github.com/nwarila-platform/.github/tree/main/docs/decision-records).
- [`template/`](template/) - byte-identical mirrors of Terraform framework
  template ADRs inherited from `NWarila/terraform-framework-template`.
- `repo/` *(empty)* - repository-specific ADRs that apply only to this repo.

| [template/0005](template/0005-classify-org-control-plane-callers-as-scaffold.md) | Classify Org Control Plane Callers as Scaffold | Accepted | 2026-05-30 | Keep namespace-specific org-control-plane callers out of byte-identity enforcement. |

### Repository-Specific

None yet. The first repository-specific ADR will live at
`repo/0001-short-kebab-title.md` and a row will be added here.

## Authoring Rules

- Org-baseline ADRs are mirrors only. Do not edit files under `org/` in this
  repository directly; update the master copy in `nwarila-platform/.github`
  and sync it down.
- Repo-specific ADRs go under `repo/`. The `repo/` namespace is independent
  of `org/`, so `org/0001` and `repo/0001` can coexist.
- Updating this index belongs in the same PR as adding a new ADR.
